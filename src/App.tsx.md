## 1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This document details the implementation of the React application's routing logic using `react-router-dom`.  The application uses a simple routing scheme to direct users to different components based on the URL.

## 2. Code Description <a name="code-description"></a>

The code utilizes the `react-router-dom` library to manage client-side routing within the React application.  It defines three routes:

| Route Path     | Component       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `/login`        | `Login`         | Handles user login functionality.          |
| `/add-sequence` | `AddSequence`   | Allows users to add new sequences.        |
| `/`             | `Home`          | Displays the application's home page.     |


The `App` component renders a `Switch` component which renders the first matching route.  This ensures that only one route is rendered at a time.

## 3. Function Details: `App` <a name="function-details-app"></a>

The `App` function is the root component of the application and is responsible for routing.

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/login">
        <Login />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/add-sequence">
        <AddSequence />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  );
}
```

**Algorithm:**

The `App` function uses a `Switch` component from `react-router-dom`. The `Switch` component iterates through its children `<Route>` components and renders the first one whose `path` prop matches the current URL.  If no route matches, nothing is rendered (though typically a 404 component would be included for a more robust application).

* **`Switch` Component:** This component ensures that only one route is rendered at a time.  If multiple routes match the current URL, only the first matching route will be rendered.
* **`Route` Component:** Each `<Route>` component defines a specific route path and the component to render when that path matches the current URL.  The `path` prop specifies the URL path to match, and the child component (e.g., `<Login />`, `<AddSequence />`, `<Home />`) is rendered if the path matches.  The order of `<Route>` components within the `Switch` matters; the first match wins.


The routing logic is straightforward.  No complex algorithms are involved. The `react-router-dom` library handles the heavy lifting of matching URLs to routes and rendering the appropriate components.
