## 1. Overview

The `reportWebVitals` function is designed to collect and report web vital metrics using the `web-vitals` library.  These metrics provide insights into the user experience of a web application. The function conditionally executes based on the presence and type of a provided callback function.


## 2. Function Signature

```typescript
const reportWebVitals = (onPerfEntry?: ReportHandler) => { ... }
```

* **`onPerfEntry?: ReportHandler`**:  This is an optional parameter.  It represents a callback function that will receive the web vital metrics.  The `ReportHandler` type is assumed to be defined within the `web-vitals` library (it's not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet). If a function is not provided or if the provided value is not a function, the metrics reporting is skipped.


## 3. Function Logic and Algorithm

The core logic of `reportWebVitals` centers around conditional execution and dynamic importing.

1. **Conditional Check:** The function first checks if `onPerfEntry` is defined and is an instance of a function using: `if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function)`. This ensures that the subsequent operations are only performed if a valid callback function is supplied.

2. **Dynamic Import:** If the condition in step 1 is met, the function uses a dynamic import statement: `import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => { ... });`. This lazily loads the `web-vitals` library, improving initial load time.  The `then` block executes after the successful import.

3. **Metric Collection and Reporting:** Inside the `then` block, five functions from `web-vitals` are invoked: `getCLS`, `getFID`, `getFCP`, `getLCP`, and `getTTFB`. Each of these functions likely measures a different aspect of website performance (Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay, First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, and Time to First Byte respectively).  Each function takes `onPerfEntry` as an argument, which suggests that each metric is passed to the provided callback function as it becomes available.

4. **Sequential Execution:** The metrics are collected sequentially (one after the other) in the `then` block.  There is no indication of parallel processing or any specific ordering dependency between the five calls.


## 4. Dependencies

The function relies on the `web-vitals` library.  This library must be available and correctly installed for the function to operate as intended.  The import statement `import('web-vitals')` handles the dynamic loading of this dependency.  The specific implementation details of the functions from `web-vitals` are outside the scope of this documentation but are critical to the proper functioning of `reportWebVitals`.
